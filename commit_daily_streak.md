# Daily Commit Streak

This file is created to maintain a daily commit streak for the project.

To maintain the daily commit streak, please make sure to:

- Commit at least once every day.
- Push your commits to the remote repository daily.

This helps in tracking progress and maintaining consistency in development.

Example commit message for daily commit:
```
chore: daily commit to maintain streak - YYYY-MM-DD
```

You can automate this process by creating a daily commit script or using git hooks.
